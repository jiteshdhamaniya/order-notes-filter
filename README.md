# Woocommerce Order Filters Plugin

The Woocommerce Order Filters Plugin is a simple and efficient solution to filter your Woocommerce orders based on specific criteria. With this plugin, you can filter orders by 'Notes' or 'Status' and additionally search by text or user.

## Features

- Filter orders by 'Notes' or 'Status'
- Search orders by text or user
- Lightweight and easy to use
- Compatible with all modern browsers

## Installation

1. Download the plugin zip file.
2. Navigate to your Wordpress Dashboard > Plugins > Add New.
3. Click on 'Upload Plugin' and choose the downloaded zip file.
4. Install and activate the plugin.

## How it works

This plugin uses jQuery to append a filter container to the Woocommerce order notes. This container includes a select box for filtering by type ('All', 'Notes', 'Status') and an input box for filtering by text or user.

When you change the selection or key up in the text input field, the plugin will filter the notes by the chosen type and text. It will then hide or show the notes based on whether they match the selected filters.

If you press 'Enter' in the text input field, the default action is prevented to improve user experience.

## Usage

Once the plugin is installed and activated, navigate to your Woocommerce orders page. You will see a new filter container above your order notes. Select your filter type and/or enter your filter text to start filtering your orders.
